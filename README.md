## Travel Trace
Every month Andelans travel out of the country for client engagement or for other official purposes. Often time, most of these places been visited by Andelans have already been visited by another fellow sometimes.
How cool will it be to have a platform where Andelans share their experience of a place they visited after their return?

#### Benefits:
- Other Andelans traveling to the same place will have an overview of life where they are heading
- They will be able to settle in quickly by knowing where to go, what to do, when they have to.

#### How it works:
- Every Andelan can login to the platform with their Andelan email without extra setup/registration
- Andelans who want to share their experience can do so simply by creating a blog-like post tied to the location of visit.
- Other Andelans can access the post and  learn from other’s experience
